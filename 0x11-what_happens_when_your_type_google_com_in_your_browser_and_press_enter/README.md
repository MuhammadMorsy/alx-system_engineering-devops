This task involves answering a common interview question about what happens when someone types a specific URL in their browser. Interviewers use this to assess a candidate's general knowledge of software engineering. Depending on the position, they may focus on a specific area of the workflow. For instance, for a front-end position, they might be interested in how the DOM renders, while for an SRE position, they may want to know about the load-balancing mechanism. It is crucial to ask the interviewer which area they want to be covered before answering the question.
