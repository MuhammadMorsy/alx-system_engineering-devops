# Postmortem

## Issue Summary.

###Duration:

1 hour and 30 minutes, from 10:15 AM to 11:45 AM PST
Impact: A significant degradation in website performance was experienced by approximately 70% of users. Users reported slow page load times, intermittent errors, and inability to complete transactions. The primary service affected was the e-commerce platform.Root Cause: A surge in traffic combined with inefficient caching mechanisms led to database overload and subsequent application slowdowns.

### Timeline:

* 10:15 AM PST: Increased error rates and slow response times detected by monitoring system.
* 10:25 AM PST: Initial investigation focused on application code and database queries.
* 10:40 AM PST: Database load spikes identified as the primary bottleneck. Caching infrastructure was examined.
* 10:55 AM PST: Decision made to implement temporary caching measures.
* 11:15 AM PST: Caching changes deployed. System stability begins to recover.
* 11:45 AM PST: System performance returns to normal levels.

### Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the issue was a combination of unexpectedly high traffic and inefficient caching. A popular product launch generated a significant surge in website visitors, overwhelming the database. The existing caching mechanism was not designed to handle such a sudden increase in load, resulting in frequent cache misses and increased database queries.

To resolve the issue, we implemented temporary caching measures. This involved increasing cache expiration times for frequently accessed data and introducing additional cache layers to distribute the load. These changes effectively reduced the burden on the database and improved overall system performance.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To prevent similar issues in the future, we will implement the following improvements:

* Enhance caching infrastructure: Expand cache capacity and implement more sophisticated caching strategies to handle traffic spikes.
* Implement load testing: Regularly conduct load tests to identify performance bottlenecks and evaluate system capacity.
* Improve monitoring: Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect performance issues earlier.
* Incident response plan: Develop a more detailed incident response plan outlining roles, responsibilities, and escalation procedures.
* Capacity planning: Conduct thorough capacity planning to anticipate future growth and resource requirements.

### Specific tasks:

* Increase cache server memory by 50%.
* Implement a distributed cache solution.
* Conduct load tests every two weeks.
* Add monitoring for database query latency.
* Create an incident response playbook.
* Update capacity planning models.
